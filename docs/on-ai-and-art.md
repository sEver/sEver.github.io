1. AI 'art' is theft.
2. All AI models are literally trained on copyrighted work, without permission or compensation to the original authors, and most earn money from it.
3. No, the fact that a lot of people are excited about the results doesn't suddenly void the copyright law in it's entirety.
  1. People were excited about Napster too, and all the other P2P networks.
  2. If I download a movie or a book from torrents, it's illegal. Does it become legal, if I did that to feed it into AI?
4. Someone who typed a description of what they want into an ai, is no more an artist, then someone ordering a pizza is a chef. 
    1. They're a user of AI image generator.
    2. You could call them "prompters", but there's no more `art` in that than in composing a google search phrase. 
5. Someone getting an image from AI is no more a creator than someone getting an image from google images.
6. AI is composing the result out of pieces of data it has stolen.
