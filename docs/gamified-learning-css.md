We're taking a look at a set of web games aimed at helping one to learn some CSS rules. 

## Codepip.com
1. https://flexboxfroggy.com - a light-hearted set of task helping cute frogs to get where they need to be with some CSS Flexbox rules. 
It starts with the very basics and gradually introduces more concepts. 

- You're given a short text description of the flexbox rules that could be useful
- You're asked to enter the rule that will position the frogs properly
- The entered CSS is auto-applied upon every change, once you enter the proper rule, it's auto-detected and you get an audio cue, and the "next" button, leading to the next task is ungreyed and moves a bit. This is a subtle and rational way of executing that user interaction, and it seems that is not so obvious, looking at some of the other examples of the gamified learning concept.

All 24 levels are doable within 30 minutes, even if you get lost at the last one ;), and the entire thing can be considered as a minimalistic Flexbox tutorial. Well done.



2. https://codepip.com/games/grid-garden/ - from the same creator. Once you create a free account, you'll get access to 4 free CSS games, althou codepip.com has many more for other languages as well. Grid garden itself is a perfect CSS Grid tutorial.

Two other free games on codepip are (to be checked)

3. https://codepip.com/games/anchoreum/ 

4. https://codepip.com/games/tailwind-trainer/
Tailwind - oh look, every few years there is a new contraption for people to in-line their CSS instead of embracing the cascade.
This one even makes money for the creator!
Reminds me of Styled Components.

## https://codingfantasy.com/
1. https://codingfantasy.com/games/flexboxadventure/play - looks like someone caught the idea of a "CSS game", and has run with it, but added full-blown example-supported course on flexbox as well, together with unfortunate attempts at humour, and "gamifying" the experience in the classical sense (as in - you aim to restore the knight's HP after he has some fight with bitcoins(?!). What seems to most loudly state that this is a try-hard attempt at gamifying is that whenever your answer is corect, you'll get an exploding fountain of confetti, trying to trigger your "uh-oh, I gained a level" reward related neuron circuits and showing a popup, that you completed the level. This is quite mobile-app-style-trying-to-get-you-hooked maneuver and we do not like that stuff. 

In Codepip games in comparison, your level gaining is shown much more subtly. The "next button" gets unblocked, coloured, and moves a little. That's it. 

We deem codingfantasy.com a product not worth recommending. 

## https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/
We have no idea whether this is a fun thing to try, because it does to things to block us:
- It requires you to create an account to play 
- The only way to create the account is to enter your email and password, not SSO with google/github or anything

Moving on

## https://preview.webflow.com/preview/flexbox-game
This is very similar to FlexboxFroggy, but instead of coding, you do everything within the WebFlow editor
- Issue: There seems to be no in-system checking whether you've completed the given puzzle properly.
There is more at https://university.webflow.com/interactive-learning

## http://www.flexboxdefense.com
+ A tower defense game where you position the towers with CSS. 
- Bad gun tower sounds. 
- Issue: The positions of the towers are updated upon leaving the edit field, not upon change. 
- Issue: every popup alert has a link "Support this project".
- The popup tries to convince you this is "gaming" by telling you you've gained "100 points"
- Not really that engaging

## https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse154/flexboxducky/
Essentially a forked reskin of the original FlexboxFroggy

## https://knightsoftheflexboxtable.com/ 
Another dungeon-style game, but this one is focused on Tailwind again, not actual CSS.
Be wary of devoting time to learning these "we'll replace raw CSS" frameworks. 
They come and go, while CSS itself is eternal.

## https://cssbattle.dev/
This seems to be a nice challange-based coding portal, but CSS focused. Kinda the CSS version of LeetCode
Our account there: https://cssbattle.dev/player/sever
Good UI, difficult challenges. You can view top 10 solutions of past challanges and learn some pretty mean CSS minimization tricks from there ;)

Oh this is gamified very nicely. Beautiful graphics. Great UI. Smooth work.
A nice tutorial on the CSS selectors.
