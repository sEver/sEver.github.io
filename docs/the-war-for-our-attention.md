# The War For Our Attention

In recent years, more and more might one fall under impression that the human attention is some kind of ultimate currency, 
coveted by all digital products, fought for often in the most bizarre ways, disturbing the user's peace of mind in the process.

Every app wants you to look into it, want's to recommend you things, either in an attempt to sell you something, 
or in an attempt to sell someone else the privilage of being higher on the list of suggestions. 

It feels like every product includes some kind of advertising channel, or some kind of a "feed". 
Every digital product seem to try to be a storefront of some kind. Cross-selling, up-selling, out-selling. 

Is commerce really necessary in all aspects of our digital lifes?

## High Profile Cases

We've been ranting about this for years now. 

### Spotify

Back in 2021, Spotify has decided to try and "promote" podcasts to people, 
making the "Episodes for you" the top row of content on the app. The suggested Podcast episodes there were mostly controversial, fear mongering, or sexual in nature NSFW clickbait. 
[Users were outraged](https://community.spotify.com/t5/Other-Podcasts-Partners-etc/Episodes-for-you-showing-disgusting-contents-on-top-of-the-app/td-p/5258445).

This, mind you, dear reader, happened on an app, that we already pay money for, as it reached users of both paid and free plans.

### Netflix

Netflix has added games to it's offer in 2021, initially offered through the mobile app.
At the time of writing (2025) the mobile games are sometimes advertised even in the big main banner at the top of netflix.com webapp. 
Paying users of a movie app, instead of getting a movie suggestion, are getting a game suggestion, 
and it's also a game for a different platform from the one they're currently using netflix on. 

As we know - Mobile games are full of borderline gambling mechanics and psychological tricks aiming to trigger addiction mechanism in their users.
Pushing these on anyone isn't going to do them any good. 

And unsurprisingly, [the users are outraged again](https://www.reddit.com/r/netflix/comments/1843gdv/disable_games/).
